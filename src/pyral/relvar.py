        An association class in Shlaer-Mellor xUML is represented by such a relvar correlation.

        The referential correlation is between a correlation relvar and two other relvars A and B.

        Correlations declare that every tuple in the correlation relvar refers to exactly one tuple of
        relvar A and exactly one tuple of relvar B. (we use lower case a and b here in the code)

        The correlation A attributes refer to an identifier of relvar A and similarly for the B components.

        Multiplicity and conditionality is specified the same as in the create_association command.

        Syntax from the TclRAL man page:

    def insert(cls, relvar: str, tuples: List[namedtuple]):
        """
        Specifies the insert of a set of tuples into the value of the relvar, modifying it in place.

        Rather than execute the insert operation immediately, it is added as a statement to the currently
        open transaction. The Transaction append operation will raise an exception if no
        transaction is currently open.

        It is often the case that a set of inserts must be executed together as a transaction
        so that relvar constraints may be checked. For example, an SM xUML super and subclass insert must
        be applied as a single transaction. In cases where a single, standalone insert will suffice,
        it is simply wrapped as a single statement transaction for simplicity.

        TclRAL does not require that a single insert be embedded in an explicit transaction so,
        in the future, a standalone insert may be supported by PyRAL.

        The TclRAL syntax is:
            relvar insert <relvarName> ?<name-value-list> ...?

        TclRAL example where an instance of Class is inserted into the SM xUML metamodel:
            relvar insert Class {Name {Accessible Shaft Level} Cnum {C1} Domain {Elevator Management}}

        Where PyRAL input is:
            relvar: 'Class'
            tuples: [ Class_i(Name='Accessible Shaft Level', Cnum='C1', Domain='Elevator Management') ]


        Note that the emtpy set may be provided which results in a no-op.

        A partition is defined such that the set of tuples in a super relvar is referenced by
        the tuples distributed across a set of one or more sub relvars. Each tuple in a sub
        relvar references some tuple in the super relvar and each tuple in the super relvar is
        referenced by one tuple in one of its sub relvars.

        This constraint implies that the tuples in the super relvar are completely partitioned
        into the disjoint sub sets given by the complete set of sub relvars.

        This constraint is used in SM xUML to support generalization relationships where
        a superclass instance population is paritioned across two or more subclass instance
        populations.

        The TclRAL syntax is:
            relvar partition <name> <super> <superAttrList>
                <sub1> <sub1AttrList>
                ...
